//30-sec bin during final waking from sleep â€” you will need to determine this for each person by looking backwards from the max value of timefromepochbegin_tosleeponset_ until the sleep state changes from awake to REM or non-REM and label that last sleep state of REM or non-REM as during final waking from sleep.
